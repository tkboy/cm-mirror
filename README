Using a local mirror
====================

When using many clients, especially in situations where bandwidth is scarce, it is better to create a local mirror of the entire server content, and to sync clients from that mirror (which requires no network access).

These instructions assume that the mirror is created in /usr/local/cm/mirror. The first step is to create and sync the mirror itself, which uses close to 10+GB of network bandwidth and a similar amount of disk space. Notice the --mirror flag, which can only be specified when creating a new client:

    $ mkdir -p /usr/local/cm/mirror
    $ cd /usr/local/cm/mirror
    $ repo init -u git://github.com/tkboy/cm-mirror.git --mirror
    $ repo sync

Once the mirror is synced, new clients can be created from it. Note that it's important to specify an absolute path:

    $ mkdir -p /usr/local/cm/master
    $ cd /usr/local/cm/master
    $ repo init -u /usr/local/cm/mirror/CyanogenMod/android.git -b ics
    (or $ repo init -u /usr/local/cm/mirror/CyanogenMod/android.git -b gingerbread)
    $ repo sync

Finally, to sync a client against the server, the mirror needs to be synced against the server, then the client against the mirror:

    $ cd /usr/local/cm/mirror
    $ repo sync
    $ cd /usr/local/cm/master
    $ repo sync

It's possible to store the mirror on a LAN server and to access it over NFS, SSH or Git. It's also possible to store it on a removable drive and to pass that drive around between users or between machines.
